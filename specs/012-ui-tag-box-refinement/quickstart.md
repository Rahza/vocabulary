# Quickstart: UI Refinements Verification

## 1. Tag Manager Layout

1. Navigate to the **Tags** page (`/tags`).
2. Verify that each tag card spans the full width of the container (single-column).
3. Verify that the tag name is clearly visible and not cut off.
4. Verify that the edit and delete icons are easily clickable.

## 2. Progress Visualizations

1. Open the **Dashboard** (`/`).
2. Look at the "Box Verteilung" chart. Verify that each box is labeled with its new icon (🌱, 🌿, etc.) and name.
3. Open a **Word Detail** drawer from the collection.
4. Verify that the box status shows the descriptive name (e.g., "Jungbaum") and icon instead of just a number.
5. Verify that the "Meisterhaft" status is consistently applied to Box 5.
