# Quickstart: UX Enhancements

## Verification Steps

### 1. Typo Helper

1. Start a training session.
2. For a word like "Ahoj", type "Ahox".
3. Verify that the UI shows a "Typo?" prompt instead of marking it red immediately.
4. Correct the character and verify it then marks as correct.

### 2. Tag Manager Layout

1. Go to `/tags` on a mobile device or resize your browser to < 400px width.
2. Verify that the tag cards are full width.
3. Verify that the "Edit" and "Delete" icons are visible and not overlapping the tag name.

### 3. Progress Breakdown

1. Go to the Dashboard (`/`).
2. Verify the new stats section showing the count of words in each Leitner Box (1-5).
3. If possible, filter by a tag and verify the breakdown updates for that category.
