# Quickstart: Verification

## Shuffling Verification
1. Open the Tag Manager (`/tags`).
2. Resize the browser to a narrow width (mobile view).
3. Verify that each tag takes up the full width of the container.

## Stats Verification
1. Open the Dashboard (`/`).
2. Add a word with NO tags. Verify the total count increments by 1.
3. Add a tag to that word. Verify the total count remains the same (does not increment).
4. Add a second tag to the same word. Verify the total count remains the same.
5. Master the word (move both directions to Box 5). Verify "Mastered" count increments by 1.
