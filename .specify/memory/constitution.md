# vocabulary Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Engineering Excellence
We adhere to industry best practices to build high-quality software. Our code is clear, concise, and easy to understand. We write code for others to read and maintain.

### II. Maintainability and Extensibility
We design our systems to be maintainable and extensible. We use modular design, and follow established coding standards to ensure that new features can be added with minimal friction.

### III. User-Centric Design
The user experience is at the forefront of our design process. We build products that are intuitive, responsive, and solve real-world problems for our users.

### IV. Performance and Scalability
Our applications are designed to be performant and scalable. We proactively identify and address performance bottlenecks, and we design our architecture to handle growth.

## Governance
This constitution supersedes all other development practices and decisions. All code contributions, architectural decisions, and feature implementations MUST align with these principles. Amendments to this constitution require a documented proposal, a review process, and an approval from the project stewards.

All pull requests and code reviews must explicitly verify compliance with these principles. Any deviation or increase in complexity must be rigorously justified and documented.
